# Program to multiply two matrices using nested loops

# 3x3 matrix

    [4 ,5,6],
    [7 ,8,9]]
# 3x4 matrix
Y = [[5,8,1,2],
    [6,7,3,0],
    [4,5,9,1]]
# result is 3x4
result = [[0,0,0,0],
         [0,0,0,0],
         [0,0,0,0]]

# iterate through rows of X
for i in range(len(X)):
   # iterate through columns of Y
   for j in range(len(Y[0])):
       # iterate through rows of Y
       for k in range(len(Y)):
           result[i][j] += X[i][k] * Y[k][j]

for r in result:
   print(r)

# If X is a n x m matrix and Y is a m x l matrix then, XY is defined and has the dimension n x l (but YX is not defined). Here are a couple of ways to implement matrix multiplication in Python. #
